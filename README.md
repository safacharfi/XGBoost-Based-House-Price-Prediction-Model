# House Price Prediction with XGBoost Regressor

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices using the XGBoost Regressor. The project leverages gradient boosting techniques to model and forecast house prices based on various features.

## Gradient Boosting and XGBoost Regressor

### Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds models sequentially. Each new model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models. The key steps involved are:

1. **Initialize**: Start with a base model (often a simple model like a decision tree).
2. **Iterate**: For each iteration:
   - Compute the residual errors of the current model.
   - Train a new model to predict these residual errors.
   - Update the current model by adding the predictions of the new model, weighted by a learning rate.
3. **Combine**: Aggregate the predictions of all models to make the final prediction.

This iterative approach helps in reducing errors and improving model accuracy.

### XGBoost Regressor

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular and efficient implementation of gradient boosting. It extends the basic gradient boosting algorithm with several enhancements:

- **Regularization**: XGBoost includes L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to prevent overfitting, making it more robust compared to traditional gradient boosting.
- **Tree Pruning**: Uses a more efficient algorithm for tree pruning which speeds up training and improves model performance.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Automatically handles missing values during training, making it more versatile for real-world data.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes parallel processing to speed up training by leveraging multiple CPU cores.
- **Cross-validation**: Provides built-in support for cross-validation to evaluate model performance during training.

XGBoost is widely used in machine learning competitions and real-world applications due to its high performance and accuracy.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Uses XGBoost Regressor for training on the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Includes basic hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.


## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `xgboost`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)

Install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install xgboost scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Data**: Replace the placeholder data loading function with your actual data source.

2. **Preprocess the Data**: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing as required.

3. **Train the Model**: Fit the XGBoost Regressor to the training data.

4. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model performance using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.


## Results

- **R-squared Error**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Provides the average magnitude of prediction errors.
